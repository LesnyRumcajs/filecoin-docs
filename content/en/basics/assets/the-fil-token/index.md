## Uses

### Storage payments

Network users pay {{< tooltip "storage providers (SPs)" >}} in {{< tooltip "FIL" >}} for storing data for a specific storage duration.

### Retrieval payments

When a user retrieves their data, they pay SPs in FIL. This payment motivates SPs to maintain constant data availability for retrieval.

### Blockchain rewards

Network participants receive FIL for validating and adding new blocks to the blockchain. They also earn FIL for processing storage and retrieval transactions.

### Governance

Participants use FIL to vote on proposals and make decisions that impact the future development and direction of the network.
