## Exchanges

A cryptocurrency exchange is a digital platform where users can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies for other cryptocurrencies or traditional fiat currencies,like USD, EUR, or JPY. Typically, private companies run the exchanges and infrastructure that enable these transactions. 

Typically, buying cryptocurrency from an exchange is as follows:

1. Create an account with an exchange.
1. Complete the exchanges verification and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) process, if any.
1. Add funds to your account.
1. Exchange your funds for FIL or another cryptocurrency.

Potential downsides of using an exchange include hacks and regulatory uncertainty. Features, usage fees, security protocols, and supported cryptocurrencies vary between exchanges. As such, users should do their own research before using any particular exchange.
